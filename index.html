        <h2>Our Popular Tours</h2>
        <p>Tourism in Bangladesh includes tourism to World Heritage Sites, historical monuments, resorts, beaches,
          picnic spots, forests, tribal people, and wildlife of various species. Activities for tourists include
          angling, water skiing, river cruising, hiking, rowing, yachting, and sea bathing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the northern part, comprising the Rajshahi division, there are archaeological sites, including the
            temple city Puthia in Rajshahi; the largest and most ancient archaeological site, Mahasthangarh in Bogra;
            the single largest Buddhist monastery, Paharpur in Naogaon; the most ornamental terracotta Hindu temple,
            Kantaji Temple, and many rajbaris or palaces of old zamindars.
          </li>
          <li>In the southeastern part of the Chittagong Division, there are natural and hilly areas like the Chittagong
            Hill Tracts, along with sandy sea beaches. The most notable beach, in Cox's Bazar, is a contender for the
            title of the longest unbroken sandy sea beach in the world.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Ministry of Tourism and The Civil Aviation Ministry designs national policies for developing and
          promoting tourism. The Ministry also maintains the Beautiful Bangladesh campaign. Bangladesh Government has
          formed a Tourist Police unit to protect local and foreign tourists better and look after the nature and
          wildlife in the tourist spots.</p>

          <h2>Handpicked Hotels</h2>
          <p>Most hotels and major hospitality companies have set industry standards to classify hotel types. An upscale
            full-service hotel facility offers luxury amenities, full-service accommodations, an on-site restaurant, and
            the highest level of personalized service, such as a concierge, room service, and clothes-ironing staff.</p>

          <h2>World Class Service</h2>
          <p>Bogura Sovereign can trace its roots back to independent Borehamwood Travel Services which ran a fleet that
            included ex-Kelvin Central MCW Metrobuses and Northern Counties Palatines bodied Leyland Olympians and a
            collection of other vehicles.</p>

          <h2>Best Price Guarantee</h2>
          <p>Inns began to cater to richer clients in the mid-18th century, and consequently grew in grandeur and in the
            level of service provided. Sudhir Andrews traces "the birth of an organised hotel industry" to Europe's
            chalets and small hotels which catered primarily to aristocrats.</p>

        move out-of-date stock, to reward valuable customers, to encourage distribution channel members to perform a
        function, or to otherwise reward behaviors that benefit the discount issuer. Some discounts and allowances are
